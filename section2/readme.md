Instructions on how to create two Amazon S3 buckets if
you wish to follow along with the labs.
If you'd like to follow along with the step-by-step guide in this video, you’ll need to create
two S3 buckets in the AWS Development Account first. Since bucket names must be globally
unique across AWS, you won’t be able to use names like "belly-brew-development" or
"ritual-roast-source-code." Instead, choose two unique names for your buckets and create
them in the us-east-1 region.
